# Book-Recommendation
The project is a recommendation system curated to recommend books.
# Simple Recommendation System
In this Recommendation system, a weighted score has been calculated according to which top 10 books have been recommended based on vote count and average rating.
# Formula used
               W = (R*v + C*m)/(v+m)
               
               where
               W = weighted score
               R = average rating
               C = mean vote across the report
               v = number of votes
               m = minimum number of votes required for your consideration.
